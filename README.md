This project showcases the health risks facing particular demographics. I created a scatter plot that represents each state (abbreviation)  with circle elements. There is a significant disparity in income and accessibility to healthcare among the fifty states in the United States. The chart is designed for the user to decide which data to display.

** Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser. Make sure you're in the directory containing the index.html file before running the command in your terminal.
















The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml,  The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
